          With 3 years of experience matching African digital talents to local and global job markets, we still remain with a big number of jobs that remain unfilled due to the lack of experienced African Talents. <br /><br />
          Driven by our mission to place skilled and professional digital talent, we created Skills Challenges as a project-based learning solutionÂ  for talents to gain real-world experience, solve problems, and build portfolios so that they become ready for global job markets.
